            The first takeaway I had from this reading happened almost immediately. On the first page, Rethorst talks about the importance of finding meaning in the process of what you are creating, as well as forming a 
            language that can assist you in the overall goal of finding meaning and importance in a piece. Rethorst also mentions how previously she didn't have a form of language that applied to the process of her pieces. 
            Because of this, Rethorst couldn't say, nor did she have the interest in responding to “why” questions, nor did she consider what the piece would mean to the viewer. I found this to be extremely relatable. 
            I feel like I am currently in the state of trying to learn the language and resources needed to understand the importance of “why” as well as the viewer's response and relationship with the piece. This year marks 
            the first year I have ever tried to actually think through my designs and design decisions. It might sound ridiculous, but before my main and sometimes only goal was to make something look pretty. Not even necessarily 
            something functional either. It wasn't obvious before, but now It is significantly more apparent that this thought process set me and my abilities so far back. I found my younger design self being a lot more dismissive. 
            Kind of like a little kid who just wants to draw disproportionate animals with crayons and nothing else. A couple more pages in, Rethorst talks about a class she had taken that really pushed her boundaries as a choreographer. 
            She states that the class had “no starting points, no themes, no methods, and no class time to work” and that through this experience and intimidation, Rethorst was able to imagine what the experience would look like and what 
            it could teach her. Once again, incredibly relatable. This class in particular has really pushed me into understanding and deciphering why I am making something and how will someone go about interacting with it. While this 
            class does offer starting points, themes, methods, and in-class work time—something Rethorst's class did not offer—This class relates to Rethorts class in that it offers a challenge that holds intimidation but through 
            it offers work changing experience.
