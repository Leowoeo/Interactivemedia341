        <p>Quite often after cattle have been handled roughly or been through a stressfull time, they will calm them down if you leave them alone. Simply leave them feed and some water and stay away for a couple hours.</p>

         <h2>Respect Their Flight Zone</h2></a>
     <img src="Images/003.jpg" alt="A single cow in a feild" width="500px">
        <p>Never step or push too far into a cows flight or comfort zone otherwise you will cause unrest</p>

        <h2>Talk to Them in Soft, Quiet Tones</h2></a>
            <img src="Images/004.jpg" alt="Man looking at cow" width="500px">
        <p>All animals respond better and more calmly to you and your needs if you are quiet around them. Some cattle folk find that that reading a book outloud best relaxes their cows.</p>

        <h2>Have a Very Calm and Relaxed Demeanor About You</h2></a>
            <img src="Images/005.jpg" alt="Man looking at a cow eating grass" width="500px">
        <p>Don't think or worry about anything around your cows. Just live in the moment. If you're calm, they're calm.</p>
    </li>

        <a name="five">
        <h2>Let Them Come to You</h2></a>
            <img src="Images/006.jpg" alt="Man reaching out to pet cow" width="500px">
        <p>Let them choose when it's in their interest to approach you. Cows are naturally curious, so once they are calm, curiosity will take over and they will start to approach you.</p>

        <h2>Leave on a Possitive Note</h2></a>

        <p>Once your cow has calmed down enough, it would be best to leave with a good frame of mind.</p>
